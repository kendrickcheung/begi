Today was so much fun. I woke up and had breakfast with my family. We had yummy cereal and milk. Then, I went to school and learned different types of animals. I even got to hold a snake. It was so cool.

After school, I went to my friend's house. We played with her toys and had a tea party. We even made cookies and ate them all up.

When I got home. I helped my mom make dinner. We made yummy spaghetti and meatballs. After dinner, I watched my favorite cartoon show and then went to bed.

Before I went to sleep, I read a story about a princess went on an adventure. It was so exiting! I can't wait to read more tomorrow.
